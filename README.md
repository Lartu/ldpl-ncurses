The **LDPL Ncurses Library** is a [ncurses](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ncurses) wrapper
for LDPL, designed for creating terminal applications that require more complex text
user-interfaces than simple line-feeding. It aims to make it very easy to move text
across a console, change text colors, read user key-presses, etc. This library requires **LDPL 4.4** or greater. For a **LDPL 4.3** compatible version of this library check [this release](https://github.com/Lartu/ldpl-ncurses/releases/tag/1.0).

## üñºÔ∏è Example

The [Lute](https://github.com/lartu/lute) text editor was written using this library.

## üß∞ Installation

Include the library into your LDPL project by copying the folder *ldpl-ncurses* to your project directory and then adding the line:

```coffeescript
include "ldpl-ncurses/ldpl-ncurses.ldpl"
```

before the `data` and `procedure` sections of your source file. The library is
ready to be used.

In order to build against this library, you must have the **libncurses dev** package installed on your system. If you are using Debian Linux or Ubuntu Linux (or any other distribution that uses the **apt** package manager), you may install it by running `apt install libncurses-dev`. Users using other distributions or operating systems should install the package in the ways required by their respective systems. This package is just required to *develop* applications using this library, not to *use* said applications.

## üìö Documentation

This library adds a number new statements to the language:
- `NC INITIALIZE`
   - Use this statement to initialize this library. This statement **must** be called before any other statements provided by this library are used.
- `NC CLEAN UP`
   - Use this statement to restore the terminal configuration to what it was before calling `NC INITIALIZE`. This statement must be called before the program exits, or else you will end up with a messed up terminal.
- `NC GET SIZE IN <number_var> <number_var>`
   - Use this statement to get the width and height of the terminal in `<number_var>` and `<number_var>`, respectively.
- `NC MOVE TO <number> <number>`
   - Moves the cursor to the column and row defined by the passed numbers, in that order. The upper-left corner of the terminal is the 0, 0 coordinate.
- `NC WRITE <number or text>`
   - Writes the passed text or number at the current cursor position.
- `NC REPAINT`
   - In order to make this library more efficient, it doesn't output anything to the screen until this command is executed, instead it writes all text to a buffer. When this statement is executed, that buffer is copied to the screen.
- `NC SHOW CURSOR`
   - Use this statement to show the console cursor. The cursor is shown by default.
- `NC HIDE CURSOR`
   - Use this statement to hide the console cursor.
- `NC ENABLE COLOR`
   - This statement enables color. Color cannot be disabled once enabled. If this statement is not executed, text color setting will have visible effect.
- `NC SET COLOR <number>`
   - Sets the color of the foreground and background of the text to be printed from now on. `<number>` is expected to be a number (or number variable) between 1 (inclusive) and 56 (inclusive). Check the [Color Guide](https://github.com/Lartu/ldpl-ncurses#-color-guide) section of this document for more information about the available colors.
- `NC GET KEY IN <text variable>`
   - Use this statement to read user input. This statement has two modes: blocking and non-blocking. When on blocking mode, your program will halt until the user presses a key. The value of the key pressed will be stored in the passed text variable. In non-blocking mode, when this statement is executed it will try to read the value of a pressed key and store it in the passed text variable. If no key is pressed, `""` (an empty string) is stored in the variable instead. Check the [Keyboard Character Guide](https://github.com/Lartu/ldpl-ncurses#keyboard-character-guide) section of this document to read about the values stored by this statement in the passed text variable. Input is UTF-8 friendly; if you enter `√±` or `„ÅÇ`, you'll get that character in the passed text variable.
- `NC SET NON BLOCKING INPUT`
   - This statement tells LDPL to use non-blocking input. This means that when you call `NC GET KEY IN $`, your program will not wait until a key is pressed and will continue executing had a key been pressed or not. Input is blocking by default.
- `NC SET BLOCKING INPUT`
   - This statement tells LDPL to use blocking input. This means that when you call `NC GET KEY IN $`, your program will hang until a key is pressed. Input is blocking by default.
- `NC SET NON BLOCKING INPUT`
   - This statement tells LDPL to use non-blocking input. This means that when you call `NC GET KEY IN $`, your program will not wait until a key is pressed and will continue executing had a key been pressed or not.
- `NC ENABLE ECHO`
   - Use this statement to print characters as they are typed by the user when accepting input.
- `NC DISABLE ECHO`
   - Use this statement to disable the printing of characters as they are typed by the user when accepting input.
- `NC BOX <number> <number> <number> <number>`
   - Use this statement to draw a box. The box is drawn from its upper-left corner. The passed numbers are: the column of the upper-left corner of the box, the row of the upper-left corner of the box, the width of the box and the height of the box, respectively.
- `NC BOX <text> <number> <number> <number> <number>`
   - Use this statement to draw a box with a title. It works just like `NC BOX`, but the passed text value is used as the title of the box and printed on its upper side.
- `NC SHADOW BOX <number> <number> <number> <number>`
   - This statement is the same as `NC BOX` (without title) but it draws a shadow below its box.
- `NC SHADOW BOX <text> <number> <number> <number> <number>`
   - This statement is the same as `NC BOX` (with title) but it draws a shadow below its box.

## üé® Color Guide

The following colors are available when using the `NC SET COLOR $` statement.
